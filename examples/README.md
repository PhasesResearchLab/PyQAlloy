# PyQAlloy Examples

This directory contains three small tutorials that should help you get started with PyQAlloy. They will eventually be expanded to cover more advanced topics, but for now they focus on how you can use PyQAlloy's core data curation and analysis features.

1. [01.CurationULTERA](01.CurationULTERA.ipynb) - showcases how PyQAlloy is deployed over an older snapshot of the ULTERA dataset of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) to curate the dataset with all core methods. Please note **execute run this notebook, you need to have API credentials** either stored in `credentials.json` file, set using `pyqalloy.setCredentials`, or set using `pyqalloy.setCredentialsFromURI`. If you don't have them, you can still follow it along looking at the pre-computed results.
